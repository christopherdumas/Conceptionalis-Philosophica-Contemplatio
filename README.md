## Statement of Use

A philosophy is incapable of being "useful" unless it must come under the
jurisdiction of use at some point in the life-cycle of its constituent concepts
or the concepts piled atop it.

The life-cycle of a concept is formed of two parts: the co-opting of the concept
for certain uses at the same level of abstraction, and the use of that concept
or its co-opters as a rung in a ladder proceeding towards action. Thus, there is
a hierarchy of concepts from the most esoteric and distant from action, to those
that are closer to action. A concept such as the Object, from whose relations is
derived logic, can influence the formation of a concept of epistemology, which
forms the basis of the concept of science, a concept which is *used* for the
gathering of knowledge. Then the life cycle starts again: through the build-up
of a great many concepts, the knowledge collected by science is *used* to create
technology, which is then used in everyday action. Thus, the philosophy of the
Object can be "useful": it comes under the jurisdiction of "use" through its
life-cycle twice.

Thus, even the most abstract concepts can eventually become *used* for action.
So you see, for a philosophy (primarily - its constituent concepts**, usefulness
is made possible by whether anything can be piled atop it in order to aid or
hinder, guide or direct action.

**Nota bene:** this does not imply, at this stage, that the concept *is*
useful - that would imply that the concept is correct - but only that it *can
be* useful. Has the possibility to be.

Most philosophy, especially metaphysics, is not capable of being useful. This is
because it does not change the actions that must be taken, either directly, or
through any outgrowth of ethics or epistemology. This is especially true of
Cartaesian skepticism, which posits such a fundamental disconnect between mind
and world that it is impossible for anything "useful" to come of it.

Why do something that is of no use? Humans only do things that seem of no use
because either they have an ancillary use - this is so in the case of leisure -
or because they may have some sort of use in the far future - further on in
their life-cycle - and both of these circumstances are an instance of
*investment in the future,* not "doing" for its own sake. There is no reason to
do something that is of totally no use. It is a waste of time and energy.

Thus, if something can be proven to be of no use direct, there is no reason to
do it besides the ancillary - this is philosophy-as-leisure, which has its own
place - or because we hope that it might have some use that we do not or cannot
see (through unknown unknowns). This last is a vain hope in most cases,
especially, if as I have said before, the uselessness is known or proven. I do
not intend to take this metaphysician's route.

I will take a different route: I will construct the starting-place of my
philosophy, in the consciousness of the individual, with an eye towards reality
and epistemology and ethics, so that it will be guaranteed to come to some sort
of action-guiding *use* - so that it is possible that it can be "useful," even
if it turns out not to be - since I have a focus on life and action, and do not
find metaphysics leisurely.

Said another way: I intend to do philosophy so that my results must come under
the jurisdiction of use at some point in the life-cycle of its constituent
concepts or the concepts piled atop it.
