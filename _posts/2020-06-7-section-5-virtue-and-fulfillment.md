## self-interest, the seat of value, and fulfillment

If, as we discussed in [the section on axiology]({% post_url
2020-06-2-section-3-axiology %}), the seat of value - the ultimate arbiter and
experiencer of what is *valuable* - is an individual human being, it follows
then that what ultimately is "considered valuable" must be considered valuable
by the individual human being to whom that value is relevant. The only way it
can be generalized or made "objective" is to focus on the commonalities that
that human being necessarily has with others.

This might seem to open the door to relativism, and to a degree it does.
However, because there is an objectively true way to find fulfillment as a human
being, and because all human actions are taken in service of fulfillment whether
the human knows it or not, one can still say that some actions are "incorrect":
they do not serve the correctly understood goals of that human - i.e. the
rational, or enlightened, self-interest.

If there were no commonalities at all between humans, such that there was no
objective basis for human fulfillment, this claim of incorrectness would not be
possible; and even though it *is* possible to a degree, there are
fulfillment-pertinent differences between humans as well - temperament, skill,
and situation - which creates a situation in which there are aspects of the
correct pursuit of human fulfillment that are completely relative to a human, so
that they *cannot* be held as "incorrect."

Thus one can look at the actions of another human being and say: "you are
seeking and searching for something, but you do not know what it is - here are
its general outlines. These actions you are taking, because you did not know why
you were taking them, are acting against your true interests. As such, they are
incorrect, and it would be in your own interest to desist."

This means that, however, one can never ask another to subsume to your own
interest, or subsume yourself to another's interest, completely. There are many
situations, indeed most situations fit this description, where there are other
people who you care about, who it is in your enlightened self-interest to care
about, or people whose gains are also your gains - and that is perfectly
acceptable. However, you can never be asked, or ask yourself, to give up caring
about your own fulfillment at all: it is contrary to your nature, and will not
bring satisfaction. Instead, it eradicates your capability to function and value
as a human being. Someone else asking you to do so is asking you to cease your
function as a human. It can never be in your interest.

More importantly however, since one is always the seat of values *to you*, you
are the ultimate decider of what your values are - what your fulfillment is, how
it is to be achieved, what you care about. To borrow from others, or allow them
to dictate it, outside of the broad and general categories common to all humans,
is a dangerous game: for, it will never be totally accurate nor always in your
best interest. Others dictating your values for you will be tempted, and likely
eventually fall into the trap of, using that power over you to their own
advantage or the advantage of their own values which might be mutually-exclusive
with yours, either subconsciously or on purpose.

We must, then, in order to achieve true happiness and fulfillment as human
beings, always remain the ultimate decider of our own values: although we are
fallible and often mistaken as to what we truly want, and may oftentimes take
advice and seek wisdom, we must never surrender our capacity for experiencing
value and our rational faculty, which was "given to us" by our nature for the
purpose of seeking our own values. I would even say that, in fact, the very act
of using our minds to introspect and ascertain and seek what it is we truly
value is *part* of the fulfillment of our human essence, since the use of our
faculty of reason is part of that fulfillment, and this faculty is partly
designed for such things.

In addition, to believe that it is impossible to be truly fulfilled, or that we
do not have the capacity to deserve it, is to forfeit fulfillment right out of
the gate - to purposefully sacrifice any chance we might have had of finding our
own fulfillment - and to relinquish the search, so that the only way we could
end up fulfilled is through an accident, something we are likely ourselves to
throw away if we do truly believe we cannot deserve it.

**Nota bene:** when I say "deserve," that does not mean in the least that we all
deserve fulfillment without action on our own part - that is contrary to the
nature of individual fulfillment in the first place, but indeed is not the
definition I mean: when I say "deserve," it means that we have the capability to
earn our fulfillment (and continue earning it, since action is part of it), that
it is *not impossible* to earn one's fulfillment. Thus, to say: "everyone
*deserves* fulfillment" in the colloquial sense is to say that everyone, no
matter what they have or have not done should have fulfillment - whereas I say:
"everyone *can deserve* fulfillment," meaning: there is nothing in the nature of
humans that should *keep them* from deserving it, *if they take the proper
actions.*

To relegate fulfillment to another life is to destroy any possible fulfillment
in this one: to make ourselves and those around us unhappy *on purpose,* to
sacrifice the only thing we know we have for something we have no way to know is
coming.

## rationality as the center of fulfillment and self-interest

As discussed in the previous section as well, there are multiple aspects to
human fulfillment, all of which must be exercised to some degree for complete
fulfillment, but each of which can be followed as a route to what we desire.
However, it must be stressed again that the *starting place* for all this - the
thing that values, the thing that experiences, and the faculty that dictates the
nature of our fulfillment - is the *mind*: the *human mind.* And what does the
human mind do that animals' does not? What is its unique feature: nothing but
rational, conceptual thought - it is the pattern-seeker, the world-seer, the
builder, the mariner of conceptual seas!

Therefore before anything else can be done, we must use our conceptualizing
minds, we must make proper detail-elisions from the world around us and the
observations we make, understand the concept-relations that are the weaving in
the fabric of the envelope. That is the beginning. It is the first step to all
other steps.

Note that part of this *rationality*, this faculty for pattern-seeking, for
thinking, for conceptualizing, may not imply strict Aristotelian rationality:
for, when we recognize through our observations that that is *not* the correct
manner of understanding the commonalities between observed objects and their
relation-concepts, then we should discard it as necessary: this rationality
would allow for the understanding and use of Quantum Mechanics, for instance. It
is the action of conceptualization.

As a rule, however, rationality is both means and end.

## the tools of fulfillment: virtue

What we call "virtues" are specific behavior-patterns that guide the exercise of
the basic faculties, or meta-virtues, in a proper way; they function as
prerequisites for other further fulfillment. Thus, the meta-virtues are "good
ways of being," whereas the virtues are "good ways of acting" which can compose
"ways of being." The meta-virtues are named such because they are a *higher*
component of this conception of fulfillment, composed of the lower concepts -
although the meta-virtues are more fundamental as well.

There are perhaps almost as many virtues as there are people, considering the
wide interpretability of the three meta-virtues/fulfillment-aspects of human
beings; hence it might be easier to list only what is *not* a virtue.
Nevertheless, I will endeavor to illustrate what I consider to be the central
virtues. I will attempt to select from the list of Aristotalian virtues, since
Aristotle's Virtue Ethics is the wellspring of my inspiration on the matter.
Again, the list of virtues is not limited to these - these are *merely examples*
for further consideration and extrapolation.

I have made those virtues bold which are the strongest outgrowth of the
meta-virtues, with the most direct content from them and the least influence of
the animal nature.

|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Justice**             | The application of reason and by extension universalizability - as we will see later - to the area of human affairs apportioning to what reward or punishment each should be accorded, and the judging of when it is within the authority of the virtuous human to meet out that reward or punishment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Truthfulness**        | The application of reason rigorously and with no purposeful blindness, to all matters at hand, without self- or other- deception.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Modesty/Self-Esteem** | The application of reason rigorously and with no purposeful blindness to oneself, to find a balance between honestly assessing one's flaws and communicating them, and needlessly tearing oneself down so that one believes that they are no longer worthy of fulfillment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Wit                     | The application of reason, through rhetoric, to one's interactions with others on a more superficial level, to understand how one should act towards others: timing and manners, among other things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Ambition**            | This is part of the drive, mentioned in the virtue of Self-Esteem, that motivates one to actually reach for the goals one has selected in keeping with your personal fulfillment. Someone who lacks ambition totally is inert and of no use to anyone. They are not truly productive of anything new.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Productivity**        | A direct outgrowth of the human ability to create: no human is complete as simply a *consumer*; the life of a leech is not a life proper to the human fulfillment we have in common purely by the fact that not all humans can choose this kind of life: it cannot be the proper exercise of human faculty because for it to be possible, there must be other humans to leech from - it depends indelibly on its non-universalizability as a method for life. Productivity, on the other hand, is universalizable, and so it is possible (and it is so as well) for it to be the proper mode of human life. |
| **Peacefulness**        | This is an outgrowth of the social aspect of humanity: we are not animals that must use coercion, force, or tradition to get what we want - we have other, more beneficial over all, options. We do not abide by the law of the jungle - for we left the jungle behind millennia ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Temperance**          | Knowing how to govern oneself, through the use of your mind, to overcome those animalistic urges which, while they must be satisfied to a degree, should not be *indulged.*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Benevolence             | This is not a uniquely human virtue insofar as many animals, nearly all of them, in fact, have been observed to act altruisticaly and benevolently. However, this is a prosocial behavior, which can be combined with the other meta-virtues to better serve the human faculties through reciprocal behavior and building social relationships for better future voluntary interaction                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Equanimity              | Applying rationality to the world around you, to understand what you can and cannot control. This is the Stoic virtue, and only one among many.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Nota bene:** it is impossible to stress enough that this is not a complete
list of virtues. Not even the half of it! Nor is this a complete list of every
aspect or manifestation of each of the virtues listed - even that would take too
long. This is why I began with the three central meta-virtues of humanity:
peaceful social cooperation, calm rationality and intelligence, and
productiveness - these are the true and most complete description of the
virtues of a human, from which all others can be derived.

## the virtue of justice

One of the most important virtues of this assemblage, in fact likely the *most*
important, is that of Justice: it is the virtue that allows the peaceful
cooperation so necessary for the social and productive virtues, for the
improvement of human life, and for the social brotherhood that we, as prosocial
mammals, find so necessary. It is what provides a stable environment both for
ourselves and for our children, and it is what allows us to decide how we should
act with regards to others. It is the basis, in other words, of *ethics.*

Justice requires of us that we seek to understand our relationship to others and
our actions rationally, since it is primarily an outgrowth of the meta-virtue of
rationality, and that component of fulfillment itself tells us that if we were
to forsake rationality in our actions, we would find ourselves unfulfilled, cast
adrift, empty, and taken advantage, of, not to mention find precluded any
further fulfillment or even assessment of what our own values are.

Forsaking rationality in justice means that the logic behind how we behave
toward others will not be *communicable* to others who do not already agree -
will not be intersubjectively justifiable - and thus will not aid in conflict
resolution or in the stable construction of norms that would allow a healthy
society to form and for cooperation to become possible.

### assumed universalizability

The primary basis for rational justice should be the fundamental idea of
universalizability: insofar as all human beings are rational, acting, conscious
agent, they are equally so - they are either described by those things, or not -
so that any proposition of ethics or justice must treat them as equal unless
specific unequal qualities can be perceived and proved to be relevant; this I
will phrase as the "presumption of equality": insofar as justice and ethics
applies to the virtuous actor and the human beings around him, they must be
assumed equal until some reason is provided for them to be considered not.

### reciprocity and the non-aggression principle

From this idea stems another, which I will term the "reciprocity rule": any
action whatever that one takes against another, on the same measure one has no
rational grounds for objecting to it being taken against oneself, unless there
is a relevant difference to break total universalization.

Consider a situation in which Adam uses force against Bob. If Bob considers his
rights violated by Adam's act of aggression - initiation of the use of force or
violence - then he would have, in his own estimation, a legitimate license to
use force in defense or retaliation, to a commensurate degree. Any objection to
this defense or retaliation, on the part of Adam - where objection can include
verbal, legal, or physical retaliation - commits Adam to a complete
contradiction: as I have already explained in previous sections, those values
and appraisals which are strongest, and surest, in the ascertainment, both of a
human and those around him, are those which that human acts upon; therefore,
Adam has shown *in the strongest way possible*, meaning by his actions, that he
believes that the use of violence against others is allowable, and the amount of
violence that he already used, is acceptable.

**Nota bene:** I am considering "another" in the maxim above to mean only the
*body* of another for now, to simplify the discussion, but as I will prove
later, it extends to property.

At the time of his use of violence, an attacker was no different than the man he
was attacking: they were both human beings capable of fulfillment and conscious
thought, who have not yet committed violence, just as he has not. However, when
the attacker finally makes his move, he is undone by that very fact, for now he
has spoken through his actions to say that he would attack someone not
meaningfully different from himself, and hence he himself can no longer
rationally object. Furthermore, those who now attack *him* to a commensurate
degree are saying only by their actions that they will attack those who *cannot
possibly* have a rational objection to the violence used against them, which
does not apply to them: they have not committed violence against a human who is
not importantly different, in this specific sphere of the ethical concerns of
violence, than they are.

### third parties and the denial of the right to self-defense

What if we add a third party to this exchange who observes this and denies that
Bob can be just to commit his defense or retaliation against Adam? *Prima
facie*, such a party (call them Charles) has an ability to rationally object to
such a thing, by saying that nobody has any right to defense, so Bob should not
be defending himself.

This is a defense of *Adam*, however, not just a disagreement with Bob: by
saying that Bob should not (cannot justly) retaliate against Adam, it is a
positive defense of Adam's right not to be attacked unjustly itself! So you see,
by even denying Bob's right to retaliate, a moral nihilist C is implicitly
confirming the right to not have violence unjustly initiated against any actor!

**Nota bene:** notice that this conception of justice does not require that
everyone agree with the virtuous human's assessment. It does not require any
commitment from anyone else, only that the just man recognize that, rationally,
he has the "right" to retaliate or defend within the bounds set out.

### Another

What defines "another"? This will be covered in the later section on absolute
ethics, which any rational - not simply just - being must recognize as correct
for the purpose of their rational action, which establishes stronger *defense*
rights, although it does not establish any *retaliation* rights; it will also
establish the right of *property.*

## Truthfulness
