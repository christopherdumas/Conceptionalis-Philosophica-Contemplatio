## Rational & Correct Knowledge

Rational knowledge is knowledge ordered by the laws of the Object concept - i.e.
ordered by logical hierarchies of concepts and logical relation-concepts between
them through the laws of logic.

**Nota bene:** a "logical" hierarchy is one in which there are no loops, or
higher-up concepts that add incorrect details, etc - the hierarchy of concepts
must be formed strictly. An example: the fallacy of composition performs a
conceptual step up the ladder of abstraction by grouping several assembled
concepts of objects together in a single entity. However, it adds details from
its constituent concepts which are not present in a proper common grouping
concept. For example: a "car" is a grouping-concept relating the concepts of
"wheel," "tire," "body,** and so on. To say that a tire is rubber, therefore the
entire car is rubber, is to commit the fallacy of composition and construct a
hierarchy that is not logical, because it adds a detail to the grouping concept
which all the other concepts that form it do not have, meaning that the grouping
concept is not strictly a detail-elision, but partly a detail addition.

Correct knowledge is knowledge which, as well as being rational, rightly
integrates relations and details from the consciousness' envelope about the
concepts which one desires to describe with that body of knowledge.

**Nota bene:** there is a strange "loop" affect to these two concepts of
knowledge, due to the fact that, technically, the laws of logic that rational
knowledge must observe are observed by the consciousness in its envelope in the
form of the Object, so that abstractly speaking rational knowledge is just
knowledge which "rightly integrates the relations and details" of the Object as
it is observed in "from the consciousness' envelope." Yet, for any other
knowledge to be correct, since all other concepts "descend" from the Object,
that other knowledge must observe the rules of the Object first before it can
continue to be correct in its own specific way.

## Inconsistent knowledge

The primary and first rule that all actions must follow is the law of
non-contradiction, and so, since correct knowledge is judged primarily by
action, knowledge must also follow this rule. Inconsistent knowledge must be
tossed aside.

Inconsistent knowledge is not knowledge at all. It does not indicate which prong
of the contradiction should be selected, and it cannot provide an underlying
causal model of both aspects at once. Inconsistent knowledge must be reconciled,
or it is undecidable.

## proper causal models

A causal model explains what conditions or actions produce other conditions -
thus, the action "pushing this ball" produces the condition "this ball is
rolling." Causal models take the form of relation-concepts between objects,
where which relation-concepts that can be applied - and what the specific
manifestation of the relation-concept is - is determined by, as usual, the
details of the concepts being related. This is like the notion of an concept's
(or object's) actuality, its current details, and its potentiality, the
relation-concepts which that actuality allow to be applied.

We need correct knowledge with a correct causal model because only a causal
model can present the mechanism of action and reaction an understanding of which
is necessary to guide action: if one does not know what results - or even, at an
extreme, what *possible* results - actions have, how can one choose between them
to achieve results? How can one act with any logic other than randomly?

One might say "I will act randomly in order to *find out* what these actions
do." This is what babies do, and in a way what scientists do as well - we will
discuss that subject later - but that is random action in the pursuit of
*forming* a correct causal model. I.e. it is admitting that ultimately a correct
causal model is important. One cannot go without one forever, willfully ignoring
the causes and effects one sets in motion, and be said to be acting other than
randomly and thus without hope of causing anything desired to come about. One
cannot, in fact, survive at all that way.

Thus correct knowledge is required for action in pursuit of any goal - i.e. for
living - in the long run.

## expanding knowledge

Furthermore it is universally a proper and beneficial endeavor to expand and
test a causal model and rational knowledge: to test, because one must know where
the blind-spots of a model are - what it does not explain, does not predict, or
predicts incorrectly - to know how to improve it, but also to avoid acting
incorrectly and to avoid being surprised by outcomes; to expand, because more
far-reaching causal models don't only make action-outcomes better known
beforehand and thence allow better action, but because this expansion opens new
and unpredictable avenues of knowledge themselves.

## stable & unstable equilibria

Reality - the structure of it, by virtue of the essence/concept of the Object -
is, as we have discussed previously, governed by the laws of logic. If A is
true, A is indeed the case; and if A is the case, B cannot also be the case at
the same time and in the same way; and further: either A is the case or it is
not. Moreover, if A and B are mutually exclusive but mutually cover the whole
space of possibilities, C cannot be the case, and so on.

All this does not in the least mean, however, that reality must be *interacted**
with in perfectly logical ways - otherwise all action would necessarily be in
line with reality, or correct, and there would be no need for learning, since we
would all be omniscient, at least about the laws of nature - one can indeed act
as if B is true, even if A is. One can act as if the laws of logic do not apply:
as if an A is not an A, or as if a B is an A, or as if there are no As nor Bs.

**Nota bene:** all except the law of Non-Contradiction. This law is special, in
that one cannot actually act as if two contradictory things are true *at once*:
if A entails action X, and B Y, one cannot do both X and Y at the same moment.
Of course, in the real course of events there might be a middle-of-the-road
action, seemingly. But this is only true for two structures: one, if the third
action (Z) is a compound action, part of which is correct for A and part for B;
or two, if there is a spectrum from A to B. One can at various times act as if A
is true, and various other times as if it is B that is true, however, because
one holds both as true at once.

Although one can mistake reality conceptually - even so far as ignoring the LNC
in thought - and act mistakenly in light of these thoughts (since thought is an
ineradicable prerequisite for most action, and unconscious concepts for all
others), reality itself, being logical in essence, will re-assert itself.

Reassertion takes a myriad of forms, but generally: those actions not in line
with reality will fail - if predicated on a totally impossible conception,
totally; if on an only partially mistaken conception, partially (and often,
thanks to the subtility of knowledge, in strange and difficult-to-understand
ways.) Therefore a timeline of compound actions taken based on an erroneous
conception of reality will often - sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly,
sometimes with the hard abruptness of running into an immovable obstacle - begin
to cause problems for those in the vicinity of the actions as reality reasserts
itself: poisoning even actions taken correctly, either by making them difficult,
or placing reality in a state that makes the rational actions harsh indeed.

Hence, although acting incorrectly can, for a time, seem beneficial to those
effected, in the medium to long term it will come crashing down, or be reduced
to long and grinding ineffectuality, where great effort is expended simply to
beat reality back by occasionally acting rationally, and then reverting back;
this is an unstable equilibrium, and reality will tend over time to force all to
act in accordance with it in one way or another.

Acting against the logic of reality not only corrupts the timeline of action,
making life worse and actions ineffectual - it also hangs the Sword of Damocles
over the heads of the wrongheaded actors: they do not know when, if, or how,
they will run into an impenetrable wall and be dashed on the rocks of logic.
Thus, knowing - and knowingly acting - in tune with reality minimizes risks and
maximizes the long-run effectiveness of actions.

## The only way to "know"

A "proper" method of gathering knowledge is one that allows the apprehension of
concepts (relation and otherwise) concerning "objects" in the envelope of
consciousness in a way that yields either correct knowledge in broad strokes, or
yields concepts in a way that allows for the later correction of errors, or is
at least wrong in consistent ways that can be adjusted for. To go about
gathering knowledge "properly" means that the concepts and relations derived
from the process of inspecting the envelope of consciousness, the "outside
world," must not consistently or randomly be wrong with no hope of correction,
and are further guaranteed to have some connection to reality, and are not in
contradiction with the laws of the Object. Any method of gathering that falls
afoul of these rules is improper.

As I have said before, there commonly are considered to be two distinct methods
of knowing: *a priori* and *a posteriori*; however, as I mentioned in the
previous section, the phenomonological and epistemological methods by which I
derive my system preclude this distinction. Even seemingly *a priori* logic is
in fact *after*, or *post* experience. All knowledge is then brought under the
same heading: seemingly "pseudoscientific" - i.e. rational - knowledge, and
vaunted "empirical" or "scientific" knowledge. Both take observations about
reality and deduce from them according to the rules of the Object.

However, there is a small difference between ways of knowing which produces the
appearance of one or the other type of knowledge, *a priori* or *a posteriori*,
based on what the observations that are begun with are.

## Conceptual reasoning

The difference in the method of obtaining knowledge between what is called *a
priori* and *a posteriori* that gives them the appearance of being different
kinds of knowledge entirely is that the starting points that seemingly *a
priori* knowledge uses as its foundation are of a more abstract, axiomatic or
self-evident nature.

Abstract knowledge takes the form of knowledge based on highly reified
concepts - like the Object and things not a little less abstract, such as the
relation-concept of Cause-And-Effect - that, while inducted from the experience
of the consciousness of the thinker from his envelope, give the appearance of
springing fully-formed from his forehead, like Athena from the had of Zeus,
because of how remote they are from any specific experience: how they are
experienced everywhere and so seemingly nowhere, and how they are understood so
early on that it seems that they never began to understand.

Axiomatic knowledge on the other hand is knowledge that, to deny, requires its
observation or acceptance, either as part of the argument (contradiction) or as
part of the *action* that one takes to make that argument (performative
contradiction) - this latter because the ultimate arbiter of the correctness of
the concepts in a mind is its more direct interaction with reality, action, so
that if one cannot act in light of a concept at all, even if one tries, it
cannot be fit to connect directly with reality itself.

Self-evident knowledge is not itself technically "self-evident" in the sense of
being understood by everyone. However, it is understood by all who think
correctly - and this, as we have seen, implies rationally - about their
experience. Self-evident concepts are phenomenologically immanent, and obvious
to all those who care to examine their general experiences. The Object's
properties might themselves be considered to be "self-evident," for instance,
although I would be careful not to take this too far. Self-evident knowledge is
often also knowledge that is axiomatic, since any experience that is immanent to
all phenomonological experience or action is both axiomatic, since it cannot be
denied without first using it - since denial is experience and action to a
consciousness - and self-evident, since it is omnipresent.

Henceforth, therefore, I will call seemingly *a priori* knowledge "conceptual
reasoning," since it primarily uses more abstract or immanent concepts as its
basis instead of specific details, and since active, far-afield observation of
the consciousness' envelope is not required.

## Observational reasoning

*A posteriori* knowledge relies on the same mechanism as explained above, the
observation of the envelope of consciousness in some way, and then the deduction
or induction from it of relation-concepts and concepts. However, this form of
knowledge relies on slightly different methods, since it does not take as its
basis and subject self-evident, axiomatic, or abstract knowledge, but instead
specific and detailed knowledge about facts and objects in the envelope. The
difference between this mode of acquiring knowledge and the mode of conceptual
reasoning, in focus in more external facts and more detailed and specific
knowledge, requires changes in methodology, since the understanding of details
mediated more by the specific instance of senses is more uncertain.

The methodology changes match the recognition of the fact that: the primary
function of knowledge is use, and as such must provide guidance for action.
Guidance for action in the form of knowledge is must useful as a causal model. A
causal model establishes what effect follows what cause, and under what
conditions. Therefore, to test a causal model, one must examine the *prediction*
that a causal model makes, and then instantiate the conditions and causes that
should produce that prediction, and note the differences - if any - between the
new conditions that result, and those predicted by the causal model. This
describes the function of forming hypotheses in observational reasoning
providing ways of testing the causal model in precise and predictable ways.

One important aspect of this method of testing is that the conditions must be
controlled as well as the causes. This is because conditions are causes
themselves and effect the outcome, and conditions are, due to their broadness,
usually not as easily accounted for in a causal model as direct causes;
conditions are also generally the changeable and incidental aspect of the
relation-concept the observer seeks to establish. Thus, control of variables is
important.

In addition, methodology must change to recognize the fact that, while the
senses are less easily fooled in cases of knowledge such as knowledge of the
Object, which mediate all action and are thus broadly attested to in every
action besides and ignoring technical detail, they are more likely to be fooled
in cases of specific detail. Thus, repeatability of testing is important, since
repeatability allows hidden variables not accounted for in the held-conditions
of a test to be factored out, and allow specific fooled senses to be ruled out
as well.

Moreover, since each human consciousness has its own understanding and
perception, one must be careful about bias, since bias is not an inherent
property in the universe - there is an objective truth - which one can see by
the fact that people who do not acknowledge objective truth, who stick to
"their" truth, fail to act properly if their actions come into contact with
reality as such. To factor out bias, other people with other biases must examine
the testing of these causal models, to ensure that they consistently seem to
predict and verify the same conclusions even when observed through different
lenses.

**Nota bene:** note how this relies much more heavily on knowledge as a causal
model for action than conceptual reasoning does. This is because action is a
much more direct method of interacting with reality, so is easier to deal with
when the senses might be fooled in myriad ways. Conceptual reasoning does not
have this limitation as much, since it can provide conceptual models for other
things. This is why there is such a divide between philosophy, which is
primarily conceptual reasoning, and science, which is observational reasoning.
This is why, also, science focuses on things that are "falsifiable" -
disprovable by action: things that cannot be disproved by action are not things
that can ever adversely impact action. This also explains why science produces
such direct and useful results on the whole: it focuses on action, and therefore
on use.

## Observational reasoning outside a causal model

Knowledge outside a causal model is concerned with such things as aethetics,
epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, and the other fields of philosophy, which
seek to explain the underpinnings of why such things as knowledge matter, or
what the correct way to gain knowledge is, without which one cannot justify
observational reasoning, but which do not make specific predictions about the
causes and effects of actions except through their outgrowth *in* observational
reasoning.

One cannot therefore use observational reasoning to assess its ancestors in the
conceptual hierarchy: it is justified by them, firstly, but also because they do
not make predictions except the predictions themselves. They do not establish
what kind of B follows a certain A. One cannot make and test a hypothesis about
whether it is possible to know if one is a brain-in-a-vat.
