### The Existence of the External World

Consciousness only exists in virtue of being conscious *of* something; something
which exists prior to or outside of the consciousness itself, since to be
conscious of itself without a prior subject is to be conscious of something
which has not come into being yet, i.e. is impossible. This "something" then is
prior to and external to consciousness and clearly not controlled by it - we
would know if reality was controlled by our own perceptions of it - so, whatever
its metaphysical origin (material, ideal, monadic, an evil daemon), we can call
it "the world."

Whether it is truly real, it is an external fact which we must act in accordance
with, so its philosophical reality is immaterial - literally.

### Detail-Elision Theory of Concept-Formation

How do we understand and speak about this world? (The two are really the same:
how do you truly understand that which you are not capable of explaining?)
Through firstly the use of concepts. Concepts are formed through the intimate
interaction between consciousness - which we know is a pattern-seeker - and its
envelope; they represent patterns of objects that are similar: this they do by
selecting the unchanging aspects of the objects and eliding the changing or
unimportant details. For example: "dog" and "cat** are concepts formed by the
elision of some details of the real-world objects.

**Nota bene:** concepts cannot be formed unless one has two or more examples of
the class of object one wishes to categorize - both for the concept to be
useful, and for it to be possible for one to know which details are important or
unchanging among the class, and which are not.

Which concepts are chosen by the pattern-seeker of consciousness depends on
which ones are more useful categories for thinking in the environment around the
consciousness; this is why discussion is so important: sharing concepts that
were formed by one group, which had not been formed by the other, with the
other, in its station as interlocutor.

### Reference Theory of Meaning

Speaking of discussion, this leads me to language. Language is formed by words
and sentences; I am interested here, initially, in words and verbs - words which
by virtue of reference are meaningful.

What gives words their reference-meaning? The agreement between pattern-seekers
who use that word. An arrangement of syllables does not, after all,
spontaneously acquire meaning in our minds simply by virtue of its innate sound.
Just look at a truly foreign language and ask yourself if any of these words
mean anything to you by themselves - and you will see what I mean. It is not the
word itself, but the "linguistic tacit contract" of a society that grants
reference (and thus **meaning**) to words.

**Nota bene:** Once this contract is established, of course, it can be made
explicit throught he use of dictionaries, but *not* before.

But what do these words refer to? Proper nouns refer to specific things with no
detail purposefully elided, but otherwise these words *refer* to concepts.

### The Method of Concept Abstraction

This might seem somewhat limiting at first - a roundabout way of reinventing
Wittgenstein or logical positivism - since words seem now to have to refer only
to classes of physical things (or events), but this is why I must now introduce
a complication: concepts (which words refer to) may also be formed by a
detail-elision applied to other concepts, so that all concepts are based
ultimately on reality, but at many possible *levels of abstraction.* So from dog
and cat to mammal, vertebrate, and then animal.

### Sense & Reference

Another complication is necessary, this time to the meaning of words themselves:
words have not only reference but sense to contribute to their meaning; sense is
what a word contributes to a statement beyond its actual reference, and also
what the speaker thinks *about* the referant of the word.

An example: Oedipus' mother, Jocasta, and Oedipus' wife (tragically) all refer
to the same person - the same concrete concept, we might say - but they seem to
mean different things because they contribute different ideas about referant.

Another example: the morning star and the evening star are the same star, but
each word has a different surrounding context for the speaker, so they carry
different sense.


### Statements and the Concept Theory of Conjunctions

What about sentences, then? What are they in relation to this structure of
meaning? They are relations: they relate the situation or meaning of the
concept-words that they are composed of using other more general concepts, which
we call operators or conjunctions; these conjunctions are formed by eliding
details about the specific situation and objects of certain common relations
which we observe between objects int he world outside.

Among these we find: cause and effect, simultaneity - our entire sense of time,
in fact - and also the operations known as the laws of logic, which represent
perhaps the most abstract concepts of all.

### Analytic & Synthetic

As Kant says, there are two different kinds of relations between concepts, which
he termed "analytic" and "synthetic": analytic sentences are those that explain
or spin-out the implications of concepts themselves, showing how other concepts
result from them or are contained within them already - a bachelor is unmarried,
to use a cliche example - while synthetic statements examine the relationship
between two concepts separately derived - such as that the street is wet after
it rains - a relationship which is usually not necessary in all cases, since the
relationship must be observed separately from either concept.

### Developmental Theory of Reality

Unlike Kant, I do not think that there are any real concepts which we need to
perceive at all; infants come into the word not yet comprehending basic things
such as object permanence, time, or cause and effect, or even the laws of logic
(this is why peek-a-boo and such simple games are a delight to them**, but learn
them through experience of reality.

This is not to say that we are *tabula rasa* - far from it! For, we come into
being primed with a mechanism of forming concepts and learning language.

How do we know that our concepts and thought-patterns are capable of being
correct, if they are derived through the faulty mediation of the sense and our
fallible minds? We know that we do make mistakes often, but if our knowledge
capabilities were entirely divorced from reality they would be of no use to us.

We evolved in an environment where something so resource-consuming as a large
brain capable of complex thought like the one we of the *Homo* genus developed
was a huge disadvantage. We would not have developed it, and would certainly not
have maintained it, unless it was of some benefit to us - and moreover! of a
great benefit to us: enough to make up for the calorie loss and the difficulty
in birthing which causes greater mortality rates in mothers and children.

How did this great big brain help us, then? If it was useless for guiding
action, it would do nothing for us in the action-filled world of nature. No, it
guides action, and usefully, too. Usefully means: in accordance with reality.
And how does it guide action? By forming general concepts and applying them. So
incorrectly formed concepts might work in the situation in which they were
formed, but they would not work even in a similar situation - wrong concepts
would the creation of "over-fitting" and would work only in the situation where
they were observed, not the situation with similar enough features that correct
concepts would apply.

We developed also in an environment where correct action was needed to survive
and incorrect action was harshly punished, so that those whose ability to form
concepts wasn't good enough, who formed them too few or too incorrectly, died
quickly, while those better succeeded and passed their genetic code down.

Thus over time, through the pressures of a reality which punishes acting against
its logic, because our concepts mediate our interaction with reality and thus
our actions, and because our actions were the arbiter of our survival and
development through reproduction, the capability for understanding the world
correctly - so that we could act correctly - was born.

Evolution does not produce anything perfect, however, so we are saddled with
cognitive biases: relation-concepts such as *post hoc ergo propter hoc* and
confirmation bias, which we used confidently in our reasoning because they
seemed correct to use, because it wasn't necessary for our survival for
evolution to cull them.

However, when we learned that these fallacies were not compatible with our more
basic and useful relation-concepts, and when we learned further, using tools we
ourselves developed consciously - using our concept formation utility against
its natural progenitor - that these concept-relations did not guide action well
and truly, we cataloged them and put up WANTED signs for them, to remind
ourselves often to avoid them. Thus we have a self-correcting faculty.

### The "OBJECT"

Through this connection to reality which I have described, we can with time know
which parts of our concept group apply to reality and us, and which only seem
to. That is how we can know that reality acts by logic: the common features of
objects, which we carefully and correctly observe, which form the concept of
Object itself, to us necessitate the action of the Laws of Logic, and these
general conceptual features are so general that they would apply to any object
whatever that we would recognize as an object - we know from the details of the
concept of Object that the laws of logic are true for it, and thus for
everything in our world.

Let me explain it another way: we have a method of, when we are careful,
correctly abstracting concepts, first from our empirical experiences, and
thence from each other. If we proceed up a hierarchy of concepts formed from
detail-elision, to the very top of what we would recognize as a concept that
could be unambiguously applied to objects in the world, to the most abstract
thing that still has ontological and material being, we call this concept
Object.

This concept itself, still contains a few details. Very few indeed, but I
profess that I could count three among them, that anything which we could
recognize as "real" must follow:

1. The Law of Non-Contradiction
2. The Law of Identity
3. The Law of The Excluded Middle

Note that I only use Aristotle's Three, and do not give Schopenhauer his fourth,
the principle of Sufficient Reason, which can be stated thusly: "Of everything
that is, it can be found why it is." This is not obvious to me, nor can it be
justified in my framework of the Object.

Anything within this Universe, which has physical reality as we recognize it,
must follow these laws. Thus, reality is rational.

### A Priori concepts

One implication of all this is that there is no such thing as a truly *a priori*
concept - if there was, it would not possess any necessary connection to
reality.

Instead, most things that seem *a priori* are simply highly reified and
culturally/socially imparted or empirically experienced with phenomonological
force (see section two) rule-concepts relating to the Object.

The rest of *a priori* ideas, such as they are - and it is a small burden to
bear for the concept of *a priori* - are derived from the experience of
ancestors through the mediator of action and the scorekeeper of development.

This means that rationalism, proceeding from one proper concept to another in a
manner commonly referred to as *a priori* synthetic, is simply the working-out
of the most fundamental emperical truths we are capable of grasping; *a priori*
synthetic truths are thus just as - and likely more - related to reality as
scientifically determined observations, and more likely to give a correct causal
model of what is happening "behind the curtain of experience." We will speak of
these things more in depth later, though.
