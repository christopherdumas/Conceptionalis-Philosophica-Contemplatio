### The Existence of the External World

Consciousness only exists in virtue of being conscious *of* something; something
which exists prior to or outside of the consciousness itself, since to be
conscious of itself without a prior subject is to be conscious of something
which has not come into being yet, i.e. is impossible. This "something" then is
prior to and external to consciousness and clearly not controlled by it - we
would know if reality was controlled by our own perceptions of it - so, whatever
its metaphysical origin (material, ideal, monadic, an evil daemon), we can call
it "the world."

Whether it is truly real, it is an external fact which we must act in accordance
with, so its philosophical reality is immaterial - literally.
